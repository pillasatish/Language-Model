# Langauge Model

In the project, we are buliding Language model using Recurrent Neural to determine the probability of a given sequence of words occurring in a sentence. 

***
The project has been written in Python and consists in a Jupyter notebook(google colab) containing both the source code and the project documentation.

Dataset: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61262/61262-0.txt
Load the data into google colab using file upload option. 

The main Python libraries used to design the source code are Keras and tensor-flow. 

**CODE**
The Language_model.IPNYB file contains the source code for the entire project. For line of the code there is clear instruction of why were are running the particular code block.

**Report**
Language_model_B210472095_SATISH_PILLA.pdf is the overall report of the project. The report is organized as follows:

1 Introduction	

2 Model Hyperparameters

3 Results
